<h3>Structure of S. Town Episode</h3>

    <p>The structure of this podcast falls in a story form that is mostly exploratory in nature. The main host explores a central character-John B. McLemore-and his setting-"Shit Town", Alabama.</p>


<h3>Who Does the Talking?</h3>
    
    <p>Most of the talking is done by Brian Reed, the host, and John B., captured through recorded conversations.</p>
    

<h3>Is it Scripted?</h3>
    
    <p>Brian's narration could be a bit scripted but it flows very well. The informal conversations with John B. are definitely not scripted but Brian could have prepared questions for John B. before their meetings.</p>

<h3>Interviews?</h3>
    
   <p>This episode is primarily composed of informal interviews between Brian and John B., interspersed with Brian's narration of the story.</p> 
    
<h3>Sound Effects and Music?</h3>
    
    <p>Sound effects and music were used quite a bit throughout this show. They were:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type:circle">
    <li><p>Plucky violin music (played at beginning)</p></li>
    <li><p>Light ambient music in the background (embellishes certain parts of the story)</p></li>
    <li><p>Ends with the song "A Rose for Emily" by the Zombies because of its connection to the Faulkner book mentioned in the story</p></li>
</ul>

<h3>Structure of Serial Episode</h3>

    <p>The structure of this podcast episode is set in a story form, told primarily by the main host and interspersed with live recordings that help move the story along. This is a crime podcast that is also very character-driven; new characters integral to the story are always introduced.</p>


<h3>Who Does the Talking?</h3>
    
    <p>Most of the talking is done by the show's host, Sarah Koenig. But many times you will hear snippets of voices of other characters that are part of the story.</p>
    
<h3>Is it Scripted?</h3>
    
    <p>Perhaps Sarah Koenig's speaking points are a bit scripted, but the way in which she delivers them is very natural and makes the story flow well.</p>

<h3>Interviews?</h3>
    
    <p>Apart from Sarah's storytelling, the majority of the episode is made up of formal interrogations that were previously recorded and informal interviews with characters that drive this story.</p>
    
<h3>Sound Effects and Music?</h3>
    
<p>The main sound sequence that pops up is a mysterious, tip-toeing type melody that repeats at the beginning, end, and sometimes throughout the episode.</p>
