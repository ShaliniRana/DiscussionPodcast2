<h3>Structure of S. Town Episode</h3>

    <p>The structure of this podcast falls in the form of informal conversation, in which multiple male speakers discuss a certain topic.</p>


<h3>Who Does the Talking?</h3>
    
    <p>Multiple male speakers do the talking in this podcast. Oftentimes, they will speak a bit over each other in order to narrate different parts of the story--as if to fill in the gaps another person misses. Once the program actually starts, there's mostly two guys who do the talking. The speed of talking is fast-paced and quick-witted throughout the podcast.</p>
    

<h3>Is it Scripted?</h3>
    
    <p>Since the podcast is conversational in nature, it does not seem to be too scripted. Perhaps each speaker had previously written out talking points based on the topic at hand and they improvised conversation and riffed off of each other to keep the fast-paced nature of the show going.</p>

<h3>Interviews?</h3>
    
   <p>The speakers do seem to interview other people on the show, but these interviews are structured more like informal conversation. I enjoyed some of the off-topic, humorous comments made by the speakers, which really created a light-hearted mood throughout the show.</p> 
    
<h3>Sound Effects and Music?</h3>
    
    <p>Sound effects and music were used heavily throughout this show. They were:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type:circle">
    <li><p>Coffee</p></li>
    <li><p>Tea</p></li>
    <li><p>Milk</p></li>
</ul>

<h3>Structure of Serial Episode</h3>

    <p>The structure of this podcast episode is set in a story form, created through different fragments of recorded conversations.</p>


<h3>Who Does the Talking?</h3>
    
    <p>Most of the talking is done by the main character, Heidi, while she converses with other male characters in the story. However, in some conversations, she is overshadowed by the male speakers.</p>
    
<h3>Is it Scripted?</h3>
    
    <p>The conversations heard throughout the podcast definitely sound scripted, as if they are played by actors. This story really reminds me of a movie because of the way the characters talk to each other in a dramatic way. Also, the jumping between different fragmented conversations reminds me of how scenes cut in and out in movies.</p>

<h3>Interviews?</h3>
    
    <p>There is a very distinct interview that goes on between Heidi and a male suspect of some crime, it seems. She asks him questions as if interrogating him. At the end of the podcast, the creator of the show is interviewed and analyzes different aspects of the story.</p>
    
<h3>Sound Effects and Music?</h3>
    
<p>There is not a heavy use of music in this podcast (as compared to the other one). The main piece of music we hear at the beginning of the show and the end is eerie piano music. You also hear a phone buzzing and the chattering of people in the background of one recording.</p>
